# Project Hotel Chatbot

For this project we decided to make a chatbot for a hotel reception desk. This set up some different challenges for us that we manage to overcome as a team. 

## The problem

We approached the different problems in several ways. We did a lot of trial/error. However when we got stuck we asked for help in the StackOverflow. Our biggest problem was creating a second input wrapper with new text input from the user. We solved this problem by talking it through together and trying several things. If we had more time we would make the general hotel page look more real.
