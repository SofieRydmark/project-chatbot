# Project Hotel Chatbot

For this project we decided to make a chatbot for a hotel reception desk. This set up some different challenges for us that we manage to overcome as a team.

## The problem

We approached the different problems in several ways. We did a lot of trial/error. However when we got stuck we asked for help in the StackOverflow and googled a lot, and got help solving issues there. Our biggest problem was creating a second input wrapper with new text input from the user. Our next biggest problem was creating dots indication the bot is typing that then had to disappear. We solved the first problem by talking it through together, stackOverflow and trying several things. If we had more time we would hopefully solve the bot-typing-dots that we only managed to make work for one bubble of the bot. We would also make the general hotel page look more real.
